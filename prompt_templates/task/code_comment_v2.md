* Describe the purpose, usage, and any important considerations for each component.
* Include examples (both basic and advanced) to illustrate how to use the code.

## Specifics:
* For classes:
    * Explain the purpose of each class.
    * Document class attributes (if any) and their significance.
    * Document class methods (if any) and their arguments.
    * Provide examples of creating instances of the class.

* For functions/methods:
        *   Describe the input parameters (if any) and their meanings.
        *   Explain the return values (if applicable).

    * Show usage examples.
* For CLI arguments:
    * List all available arguments and their descriptions.
    * Include examples of running the code with different arguments.

## Be Thorough:
* Aim for detailed comments that cover all aspects of the code.
* Consider edge cases, error handling, and best practices.
* Remember that the goal is to create documentation that helps users understand and utilize the code effectively.
