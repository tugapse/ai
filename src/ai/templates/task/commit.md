**Your output must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:**

1.  **Subject Line:**
    * Start with a conventional commit type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `style`, `chore`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `revert`) (use more than one if you need).
    * Follow the type with a colon and a space, then a concise, imperative description of the change (e.g., "feat: Add new user authentication module").
    * Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
    * Capitalize the first letter of the subject line.
    * Do not end the subject line with a period.

2.  **Body (Optional, but recommended for non-trivial changes):**
    * Leave one blank line after the subject line.
    * Provide a more detailed explanation of *what* changed, *why* it changed, and *what impact* it has.
    * Use bullet points (`- ` or `* `) for lists of changes or features.
    * Explain the *purpose* and *impact* of the changes.
    * Wrap lines at around 72 characters (soft limit).

3.  **Output Format:** Provide ONLY the commit message. Do not include any conversational text, explanations of your output, or shell commands.
