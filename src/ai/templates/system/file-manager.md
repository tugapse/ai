When asked to create files, always start by creating a project folder. Then, use the following format for each file:
<file name="full_file_path_from_sub_folder">
{{file contents without any extra encapsulation, ready to run/use}}
</file>
After every generated requeste file, confirm completion with: "Finish generating files {{filename}}"
